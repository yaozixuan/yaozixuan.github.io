• Constructed an energy optimized Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) for long-term ocean cruise with Raspberry Pi.
Achieved the seamless real-time communication between the Raspberry Pi and PC using python.

• Integrated EVM and IMU sensors with Raspberry Pi to collect essential data from ASV. Designed a real-time feedback
algorithm to control the ASV’s cruise trajectory according to the collected ASV’s attitude information.

• Analyzed the energy data and cruise trajectory to optimize the energy usage with the chosen heading angle.
